Project with React + Vite + TypeScript + Appwrite

This project is a web application built using **React**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Appwrite** as the cloud backend. This modern and efficient combination of technologies provides a fast development process and reliable app performance.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - Library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** - A fast bundler optimized for development.
- **TypeScript** - Static typing for JavaScript.
- **Appwrite** - Cloud server for managing authentication, databases, and other services.
- **Radix UI** - A library for building accessible and highly customizable UI components.
- **Styled Components** - A library for styling components using CSS in JavaScript.

## Unique Design

This project uses a **unique design** and **logo**, specifically created for this application. All UI components have been styled using modern technologies:

- **Radix UI** ensures accessibility and usability of components like modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and other UI elements.
- **Styled Components** allows for modular and convenient styling, tying styles directly to components, ensuring good code readability and maintainability.

## SEO Optimization and Accessibility

This project features **SEO optimization** with a focus on improving search engine visibility and enhancing accessibility for users:

- **Semantic HTML tags** — To improve SEO and accessibility, proper HTML structures are used, such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, helping search engines and users better understand the content structure.
- **Accessibility** — Built-in accessibility features from **Radix UI** ensure that the UI components are accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Responsiveness** — The site is fully responsive and renders correctly on various devices (mobile phones, tablets, desktops) thanks to flexible layouts and media queries.

## Backend with Appwrite

The backend of this application is implemented using **Appwrite**, a cloud solution for authentication, data storage, and other server-side functions. Features include:

- **Appwrite Cloud Functions** — Server-side tasks (e.g., data processing, external API interactions) are handled using **cloud functions** provided by Appwrite. This allows for easy scaling without the need to maintain your own servers.
